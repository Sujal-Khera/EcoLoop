# Waste Classification Model

This model classifies waste items into three categories:
- Recyclable
- Compostable
- General Waste

## Model Description

The model is based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture and has been trained on a custom dataset of waste images. It uses the `google/vit-base-patch16-224` backbone and has been fine-tuned for waste classification.

## Usage

```python
from transformers import ViTForImageClassification, ViTImageProcessor
from PIL import Image

# Load model and processor
model = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained("your-username/waste-classifier")
processor = ViTImageProcessor.from_pretrained("your-username/waste-classifier")

# Load and preprocess image
image = Image.open("path_to_image.jpg")
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

# Get prediction
outputs = model(**inputs)
predicted_class = outputs.logits.argmax(-1).item()
classes = ['compostable', 'general_waste', 'recyclable']
prediction = classes[predicted_class]
```

## Training Data

The model was trained on a custom dataset of waste images, including:
- Recyclable items (plastic, glass, metal, paper)
- Compostable items (food waste, plant materials)
- General waste (non-recyclable materials)

## Performance

The model achieves the following performance metrics:
- Accuracy: ~X%
- Precision: ~X%
- Recall: ~X%
- F1 Score: ~X%

## Limitations

- The model works best with clear, well-lit images
- Performance may vary with different lighting conditions
- Some items may be ambiguous between categories
